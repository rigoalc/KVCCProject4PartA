<title>Project 4 Part A</title>
<!--
Part A (50 Points) - Write a simple programming solution that will get a value from the user and will return a result that is based on user input.

Get some integer (whole number) value from the user with a text box.

Ask them for the amount of US Dollars they want to exchange into British Pounds Sterling.

For simplicity, use a conversion formula of 1 US Dollar is 1.30  British Pounds Sterling.

So ... gbp= dollars * 1.30;

Write an "if" statement that will give one of two different output.

If it is greater than or equal to 1,000 dollars, tell the user that "____ dollars is a lot of money to exchange. $____ US will be £ ____ ."

If it is less than 1000 dollars tell the user: " $____ US is £ ____. Have a nice day."

<script>

function convertDollarsToPounds(){

    var dollars = parseInt(document.getElementById("dollarinput").value);
    var pounds = (dollars * 1.30).toFixed(2);
    var msg = "$" + dollars;

    if (dollars >= 1000){

        msg += " Dollars is a lot of money to exchange. $" + dollars + " US Dollars will be £" + pounds + " British Pounds Sterling."

    } else {

        msg += " US Dollars is £" + pounds + " British Pounds Sterling. Have a nice day."
    }

    document.getElementById("outputPara").innerHTML = msg;
}
